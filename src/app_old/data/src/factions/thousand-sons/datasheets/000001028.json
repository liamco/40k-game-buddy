They infuse dangerous eldritch protocols into the war engines under their command, pouring raw Warp magic into shell casings or capturing malevolent sprites within targeting cogitators, magnifying their vehicles’power. Such battle tanks and combat walkers seem to throb with barely contained sorcery, and their greater danger is apparent to those with empyric senses.","description":"Each time a Thousand Sons Vehicle unit from your army is selected to shoot or fight, apply one of the following when resolving those attacks:<br><ul><li>If that <span class=\"kwb\">VEHICLE</span> unit is within 6\" of one or more friendly Thousand Sons Psyker models, you can re-roll one Hit roll, one Wound roll and one Damage roll.</li><li>Otherwise, you can re-roll one Hit roll, one Wound roll or one Damage roll.</li></ul>Each time a <span class=\"kwb\">THOUSAND</span> <span class=\"kwb\">SONS</span> <span class=\"kwb\">VEHICLE</span> model from your army with the Deadly Demise ability is destroyed while it is within 6\" of one or more friendly <span class=\"kwb\">THOUSAND</span> <span class=\"kwb\">SONS</span> <span class=\"kwb\">PSYKER</span> models, that model’s Deadly Demise ability inflicts mortal wounds on a D6 roll of 5+ instead of only a 6.","detachment":"Warpforged Cabal","detachmentId":"000001065"},{"id":"000009740","factionId":"TS","name":"Flow of Magic","legend":"With each site seized by the thrallband’s warriors, the flow of arcane energies increases, and the veil between reality and the Warp erodes. The resultant influxes of Warp energy are potent enough to invoke the flesh-change and must be channelled carefully by the thrallband’s Sorcerers. With masterful skill, they wield these mutagenic energies, expertly syphoning excess magic to empower themselves and the warriors at their command while maintaining control of their ever-expanding ritual.","description":"Certain areas of the battlefield are within your army’s Flow of Magic, as follows:<br><ul><li>Your deployment zone is always within your army’s Flow of Magic.</li><li>At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your army’s Flow of Magic.</li><li>At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your opponent’s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s Flow of Magic.</li></ul><br>Each time a <span class=\"kwb\">THOUSAND</span> <span class=\"kwb\">SONS</span> model from your army makes a Psychic Attack, re-roll a Wound roll of 1.
