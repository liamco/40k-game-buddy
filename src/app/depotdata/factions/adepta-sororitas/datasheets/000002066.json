The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll.
