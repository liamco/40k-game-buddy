If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:<br><ul><li>Advance roll</li><li>Battle-shock test</li><li>Charge roll</li><li>Damage roll</li><li>Hit roll</li><li>Saving throw</li><li>Wound roll</li></ul><br><div class=\"redExample\"><b>Example:</b> Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool.
