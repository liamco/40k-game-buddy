      "legend": "The flesh and bone ofTzeentch’s malleable servants flow like molten wax when his mutative power is invoked in ritual pleas. Some, such as the devoted Tzaangors, willingly make such requests, while more mindless abominations have their pact made for them by their callous masters. No boon is without its price, however. Some suffer changes so rapid that they burst apart, are absorbed by heaving mounds that were once allies or reduced to mewling piles of bubbling flesh.",
