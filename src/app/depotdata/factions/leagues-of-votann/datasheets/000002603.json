In her fourth turn, at the end of her Command phase, she controls one objective marker within her deployment zone, and one objective marker not within her deployment zone, and her opponent controls two objective markers. Freida gains 2YP, so she now has 8YP, and her units now have the Fortify Takeover ability instead.<br><br>During her turn, Freida uses a Stratagem that allows her to spend YP. She spends 2YP, bringing her total down to 6YP. However, units from her army still have Fortify Takeover - it will only change if, at the end of her next Command phase, she still has fewer than 7YP.</div></div>",
