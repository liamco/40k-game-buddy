Such <span class=\"kwb\">CHARACTER</span> units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.<br><br>During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.<br><br>While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are <span class=\"tooltip00001\" data-tooltip-content=\"#tooltip_content00001\"><span class=\"tt kwbu\">destroyed</span></span>, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic.
