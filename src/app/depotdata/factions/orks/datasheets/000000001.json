That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit.

Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic.
