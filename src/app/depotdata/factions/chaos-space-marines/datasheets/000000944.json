That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.<br><br>While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are <span class=\"tooltip00001\" data-tooltip-content=\"#tooltip_content00001\"><span class=\"tt kwbu\">destroyed</span></span>, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes.
