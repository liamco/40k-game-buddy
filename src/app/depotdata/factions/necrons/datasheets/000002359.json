Should a Necron be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. Crawling limbs reattach. Sundered torsos and smashed skulls reform amidst emerald sparks. Witch lights flare back to life within dead eye-lenses and the Necron rises again, shambling back into their battle line. Those Necrons too catastrophically damaged to reform vanish instead, teleported away to their tombs for repair.",

The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but currently contains 2 models, and one of those models has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many wounds are reanimated.

The second of these reanimated wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just returned.
