- BUG: Resolve the button in a button issue in the popover component
- BUG: having two weapons named the same means both can be selected at once (Gauntlets of Ultramar)
- BUG: There's tripled duplicates of NEW ORDERS stratagem and I don't know why
- BUG: If a leader has a weapon named the same as it's attached unit, both get selected at once
- BUG: Weapons and profiles don't auto select when changing phase

FEATURES
- PRIORITY: thoroughly test that the effects from leaders, abilities and state modifiers are all working
- Store certain modifiers on a units session data (damaged, below starting/half strength)
- Try to refine weapon loadouts further; if a weapon 'replaces' another, can we hide the replaced one?
- Add more scopes to modifiers e.g. damaged is only relevant to datasheets with a damaged property, while below X strength is only relevant to non-vehicle and non-monster units with more than 1 model
- If battle shocked, disable stratagem selection
- Would a range finder be useful?
