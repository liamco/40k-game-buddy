FEATURES

Lists:
- BUG: Supplement units aren't showing up for non supplement detachments

Wargear:
- Can we detect the number of 'original' weapons in the unit
    - If done correctly then in combination with the casualties, this should finally unlock the attacks counter to work properly.
- Tidy up the wargear selection with better grid columns and visually connected cards.

Leaders tab:
- BUG: supreme commanders don't auto select as warlords, nor can you select them

Engagements:
- Audit the selected lists for points value against the limit, warlord, enhancements, leaders.

Command tab;
- Plan army abilities; Which ones require a choice at command phase? Oath of moment is the selection of an enemy target; The UI could handle this.

Movement tab;
- Tidy up movement card styling

Combat tab:
- Respect movement choice; If unit advanced or fell back, weapons cannot be fires unless they have an exception. If it stayed still, heavy is active.
- Casualties overlay;
    - List all models as single cards. Tap to kill. Tap again to resurrect. This updates the unit strength.
        - The increment control would still be quicker to use in most cases, so by default, incrementing a unit strength down kills the models with default weapons first, then special weapons, then the leader. Opening the overlay would still allow to open the overlay to tweak numbers if needed.
- Add the info overlay back in

Combat state:
- For vehicles and unattached monsters, add a wound counter that replaces the unit strength input.
