- BUG: Resolve the HTML validation issues
- BUG: having two weapons named the same means both can be selected at once (Gauntlets of Ultramar)
- BUG: There's tripled duplicates of NEW ORDERS stratagem and I don't know why
- BUG: If a leader has a weapon named the same as it's attached unit, both get selected at once

FEATURES
- PRIORITY: Get damaged brackets working properly - effect needs applying to stats and attack resolver
- PRIORITY: thoroughly test that the effects from leaders, abilities, enhancements and state modifiers are all working
- PRIORITY: Store certain modifiers on a units session data (damaged, below starting/half strength)
- Tidy up all the line height problems I caused
- When swapping sides, retain selected datasheets (but swap them over)
- Try to refine weapon loadouts further; if a weapon 'replaces' another, can we hide the replaced one?
- If battle shocked, disable stratagem selection
- Would a range finder be useful?
