FEATURES
- PRIORITY: thoroughly test that the effects from leaders, abilities, enhancements and state modifiers are all working
- When a one shot weapon is used, tap it to use it and it stays unavailable for the rest of the game
- If battle shocked, disable stratagem selection
- Would a range finder be useful?

TIDYUPS
- Fonts tweaking, they're all tiny
- White buttons on active controlszw
- Disabling default weapons looks odd
- Ticker on number input looks shite
- List selectors look guff
