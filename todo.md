- BUG: if an character is attached and you add another character of that type is added to the list, the attachment looks like it breaks

FEATURES
- PRIORITY: thoroughly test that the effects from leaders, abilities, enhancements and state modifiers are all working
- PRIORITY: Store certain modifiers on a units session data (damaged, below starting/half strength)
- PRIORITY: in the attacker or defender panels, click a model name to see deets in an overlay
- When swapping sides, retain selected datasheets (but swap them over)
- When a one shot weapon is used, tap it to use it and it stays unavailable for the rest of the game
- Try to refine weapon loadouts further; if a weapon 'replaces' another, can we hide the replaced one?
- If battle shocked, disable stratagem selection
- Would a range finder be useful?
